# Context API

In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

## Why is the Context API useful?

Context allows you to pass data down to component tree without having to 'cascade' it at every component like with props.

## Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

The codex astartes does not support this action.

## What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
When you have a state in a parent component that needs to be seen in multiple children. Example “settings” for how a particular website should look.

Context is really useful for state items that don't change often, such as settings or dark mode, while redux/reducers are more robust for handling dynamic data that changes often.


## Describe “Context Hell”
When you have multiple states that needs to be pushed down through multiple child components. This creates massive quantity of nested components making it harder to understand.


# Vocabulary Terms
