# Readings: HTTP and REST

## What is a REST API
REST stands for Respresentational State Transfer.  It's a framework/architecture that allows us to use HTTP protocol to create APIs.

## Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.

## What is the advantage of an ORM, like Mongoose?

Object relational mappers allow us to interface with our database using our language of choice instead of SQL.

An advantage of using an ORM is that you can write database requests in your prefferred language.  Also adding a layer of abstraction to the database system makes it easier to switch between SQL systems such as MySQL or PostgresSQL.

## How does the repository pattern compare with an ORM?
[repo pattern vs ORM stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10155517/repository-pattern-vs-orm#:~:text=Repositories%20deal%20with%20Domain%2FBusiness,DTO%2C%20it%20only%20holds%20data.&text=You%20can%20also%20check%20this,details%20about%20the%20repository%20pattern.)
