## Why is access control important?
  Access control allows you to easily manage different what parts of your website/application your users may access and also what CRUD functions those users may perform.  This is important as different types of users need to perform different tasks, i.e. an admin needs more access than a guest.

## Describe an application that would need access control.
A blog would need different user roles such as admin, guest, editor, moderator, and author.  Each of these roles requires different access controls.

## What is a role used for?
A role can be assigned to each user that defines which CRUD functions the user can perform.  

## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
It is easier to assign a role to users and then update that role in one place, rather than go and update each individual user's access controls if changes need to be made.  Additionally, it prevents one 'power user' from crashing the system if they depart your organization.  Much easier to transfer that user's role to a new admin.

- Role Based Access Control - RBAC is the process of managing users access control via assigned roles.
- Capabilities - Another term for privileges or what actions the user is authorized to perform.
