Running JS natively on your machine allows you to write programs that take advantage of javascript's strengths.  It allows you to apply these strengths to solve problems without limiting you to running within a browser!

[stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7948494/whats-the-difference-between-a-python-module-and-a-python-package)

A module is a single file (or files) that are imported under one import and used. e.g.

import my_module

A package is a collection of modules in directories that give a package hierarchy.

from my_package.timing.danger.internets import function_of_love

## What does the node package manager do?
NPM is an open source registry of code, usually that solve one small problem very well.  You can download these prewritten building blocks to import niche expertise from other developers into your project, save yourself from repeating code that's already been written (probably better than you), and make collaborating with your team easier due to a shared understanding of the modules used.
