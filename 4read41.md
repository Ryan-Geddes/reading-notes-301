## Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

Redux Toolkit provides some tools that abstract over the setup process and handle the most common use cases, as well as include some useful utilities that will let the user simplify their application code.

Ducks is a modular pattern that collocates actions, action types and reducers.

## What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
Toolkit minimizes boiler plate from standard redux library. Configuration is less complicated and avoids need for additional libraries. Includes default middleware and thunk for async actions.  Redux Toolkit simplifies (Links to an external site.) common Redux use cases, sometimes allowing developers to drastically reduce the amount of handwritten code necessary to create their project.


# Vocabulary Terms

- **redux toolkit slices** Reducers (Links to an external site.) that are passed to combineReducers.  createSlice(): accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice.
- **namespace**  A container (Links to an external site.) created to hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers.
