## Why is authentication important?
Authentication allows us to verify (securely) that a user is in fact who they say they are.

## Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?
For obvious reasons, password storage is vitally important for security and safety of your user's data.

## What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
Hashing is one way, the hash cannot be 'unscrambled'.  Encyption is two way, the algorithm can return the encrypted data back to its original state.

## What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
Encoding is for maintaining data usability and ecryption is for maintaining data confidentiality and requires use of a key


## What is a token used for?
A token is generated for a user as a one-time use for a certain period of time. Very much like a wristband that you are given when you get into a concert, a user with a token is given a specified amount of access for a specified amount of time.
