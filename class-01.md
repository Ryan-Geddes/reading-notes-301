## RWD
[Shay Howe’s intro to RWD](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/)

Responsive websites adjust themselves automatically vs adaptive which has to be manually toggled.  Don't worry about mobile specific it's a headache.

"Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites."

### Flexible Layouts

"Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. **Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units.** These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding."

Obviously don't use fixed width measurments.

The formula is based around taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of it’s parent element. The result is the relative width of the target element:

target ÷ context = result
