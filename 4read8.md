## Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

data sanitation, user auth

## True or false: The route handler is middleware?
true! Middleware is any function that is injected into another function and runs sequentially

## In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
Middleware will terminate the process if it throws an error or passes an argument into next

## At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?

## What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

 ## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- **Middleware** - Middleware is any function that is injected into another function and runs sequentially.  In the context of express servers, it is functions that are called one after the other to modify the req/res object
- **Request Object** 
- **Response Object** 
- **Application Middleware** For full explanation see below article:
[understanding node js middleware](https://medium.com/@selvaganesh93/how-node-js-middleware-works-d8e02a936113)

- **Routing Middleware** - Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().
