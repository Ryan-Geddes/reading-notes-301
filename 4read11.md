## Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
A software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one “single” instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system

## Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
When we export a module or class, we can instantiate what is being exported so that only one instance is created. this reduces unnecessary instantiations in our app.

## If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

I would very clearly define the work that needs to be performed in the lifecycle and try to keep each middleware function as specific as possible.

# Vocabulary Terms
- **Router Middleware** Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().
- **Dynamic Module Loading**
- **Singleton Pattern** Restricts a class to a single instance
- **Mock Testing**  A technique when using testing frameworks like jest where 'dummy' data is fed in when it is impractical or impossible to test using 'real' data.
