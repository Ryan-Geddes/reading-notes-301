## Can you simply deploy a react web app to the phone?

No, React web and React Native use different markup languages.

Both React and React Native use a mixture of JavaScript and a special markup language, JSX. However, the syntax used to render elements in JSX components differs between React and React Native. Additionally, React uses some HTML and CSS, whereas React Native allows the use of native mobile user interface elements.

“React JSX renders HTML-like components like <h1>, <p>, etc. Meanwhile react-native renders native app view components like <View> , <Text>, <Image>, <ScrollView>, so you can't directly reuse your UI component code unless you rework/replace all the elements.”
